<h3>Matthew 9:20-21</h3>

<h3>New International Version (NIV)</h3>

<p>20 Just then a woman who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak. 21 She said to herself, “If I only touch his cloak, I will be healed.”</p>

<h3>Luke 8:1-2</h3>

<h3>New International Version (NIV)</h3>

<h3>The Parable of the Sower</h3>

<p>8 After this, Jesus traveled about from one town and village to another, proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of God. The Twelve were with him, 2 and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (called Magdalene) from whom seven demons had come out;</p>

<h3>Matthew 15:21-28</h3>

<h3>New International Version (NIV)</h3>

<p>The Faith of a Canaanite Woman <br />21 Leaving that place, Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon. 22 A Canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him, crying out, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter is demon-possessed and suffering terribly.” <br />23 Jesus did not answer a word. So his disciples came to him and urged him, “Send her away, for she keeps crying out after us.”<br />24 He answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of Israel.” <br />25 The woman came and knelt before him. “Lord, help me!” she said.<br />26 He replied, “It is not right to take the children’s bread and toss it to the dogs.”<br />27 “Yes it is, Lord,” she said. “Even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master’s table.”<br />28 Then Jesus said to her, “Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted.” And her daughter was healed at that moment.</p>

<h3>Mark 5:21-43</h3>

<h3>New International Version (NIV)</h3>

<p>Jesus Raises a Dead Girl and Heals a Sick Woman <br />21 When Jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake. 22 Then one of the synagogue leaders, named Jairus, came, and when he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet. 23 He pleaded earnestly with him, “My little daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live.” 24 So Jesus went with him.<br />A large crowd followed and pressed around him. 25 And a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years. 26 She had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse. 27 When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak, 28 because she thought, “If I just touch his clothes, I will be healed.” 29 Immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering. <br />30 At once Jesus realized that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and asked, “Who touched my clothes?”<br />31 “You see the people crowding against you,” his disciples answered, “and yet you can ask, ‘Who touched me?’ ”<br />32 But Jesus kept looking around to see who had done it. 33 Then the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell at his feet and, trembling with fear, told him the whole truth. 34 He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be freed from your suffering.”<br />35 While Jesus was still speaking, some people came from the house of Jairus, the synagogue leader. “Your daughter is dead,” they said. “Why bother the teacher anymore?”<br />36 Overhearing[a] what they said, Jesus told him, “Don’t be afraid; just believe.”<br />37 He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James and John the brother of James. 38 When they came to the home of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw a commotion, with people crying and wailing loudly. 39 He went in and said to them, “Why all this commotion and wailing? The child is not dead but asleep.” 40 But they laughed at him.<br />After he put them all out, he took the child’s father and mother and the disciples who were with him, and went in where the child was. 41 He took her by the hand and said to her, “Talitha koum!” (which means “Little girl, I say to you, get up!”). 42 Immediately the girl stood up and began to walk around (she was twelve years old). At this they were completely astonished. 43 He gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this, and told them to give her something to eat.</p>

<h3>Matthew 8:15</h3>

<h3>New International Version (NIV)</h3>

<p>15 He touched her hand and the fever left her, and she got up and began to wait on him.</p>

<h3>Acts 9:40</h3>

<h3>New International Version (NIV)</h3>

<p>40 Peter sent them all out of the room; then he got down on his knees and prayed. Turning toward the dead woman, he said, “Tabitha, get up.” She opened her eyes, and seeing Peter she sat up.</p></article><aside><nav id="sidebar"><ul><li><a href="/articles.html">Articles</a></li><li><a href="/healing-scriptures-women.html">Healing Scriptures</a></li><li><a href="/recipes.html">Recipes</a></li><li><a href="/referrals.html">Referrals</a></li><li><a href="/turnaround-program.html">Turn Around Program</a></li></ul><section id="contact-card"><div class="name">Dawn Lisa Borowski</div><div class="job-title">Christian Health & Wellness Coach</div><div class="address">6 Wedgewood Drive <br /> Montville NJ, 07436</div><div class="phone">(973) 332-1559</div><div class="bible-quote"><span class="cite">(3 John:2) </span><span class="quote">“Dear friend, I pray that you may enjoy good health and all that may go well with you, even as your soul is getting along well”.</span></div></section></nav></aside><footer><span class="copyright">Copyright © 2012</span><span class="decorate"> | </span><span class="title">My Christian Health Coach</span><span class="decorate"> | </span><span class="address">6 Wedgewood Drive | Montville, NJ 07436</span></footer></section><script src="/vendor/jquery-1.7.1.js"></script><script src="/vendor/modernizr-2.0.6.js"></script><script src="/vendor/underscore-1.2.3.js"></script><script src="/vendor/backbone-0.5.3.js"></script><script src="/scripts/script.js"></script></body></html>
