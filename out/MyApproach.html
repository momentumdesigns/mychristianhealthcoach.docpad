<p>I practice a holistic approach to nutrition, which means that I look at how all areas of your life are connected. Does stress at your job or in your relationship cause you to overeat? Does lack of sleep or low energy prevent you from exercising? As we work together, we look at how all parts of your life affect the whole. </p>

<p>No one diet works for everyone  </p>

<p>The concept of bio-individuality is that each person has their own nutritional needs. So, when the experts say, “dairy is good for you” or “fat is unhealthy,” it’s too much of a generalization. One person’s food is another person’s poison, and that’s why fad diets don’t work in the long run. I look at your age, health, activity level, blood type, metabolic rate and personal preferences to determine your dietary needs. </p>

<p>Everything is food  </p>

<p>Healthy relationships, a fulfilling career, regular physical activity and a spiritual practice are essential forms of nourishment. When these “primary foods” are balanced, what you eat becomes secondary.</p>

<p>Primary food is more than what is on your plate. Healthy relationships, regular physical activity, a sense of purpose and your personal relationship with the Lord can fill your soul and satisfy your hunger for life. When primary food is balanced and satiating, your life feeds you, making what you eat secondary.</p>
