# Welcome to your blank canvas for [DocPad](https://github.com/bevry/docpad)

To best use this, follow these steps

1. [Download Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)
1. Open it up, press view, layout, rows 3
1. Put your `src/documents/index.html.md` and `src/layouts/default.html.coffee` in your top row
1. Put your `src/documents/styles/style.css.styl` in the second row
1. Put your `src/documents/scripts/script.js.coffee` in the third row

This is insanely awesome as we also have docpad's autoupdate plugin enabled. So whenever you make a change, your web browser will notice and refresh :-) How awesome is that!

Later on there will be a nice video here to show you how to utilise all the awesomeness you now have in your possession, for now just refer to the [DocPad FAQ](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/wiki/FAQ)

Awesome.
