Asparagus 

This recipe is from Bryanna Clark Grogan, Vegan Chef and Cook Book Author: http://www.bryannaclarkgrogan.com 

Asparagus is a member of the Lily family. It's low in calories, less than 4 calories per spear, and contains no fat or cholesterol. It's very low in sodium and a good source of potassium, fiber (3 grams per 5.3 oz. serving). It's an excellent source of folacin, which is necessary for blood cell formation, growth, and prevention of liver disease, and a significant source of thiamine and vitamin B6. It is also one of the richest sources of rutin, a substance which strengthens capillary walls.

BROILED ASPARAGUS My favorite way to prepare asparagus these days is to trim it, cut it into 2" diagonally-cut pieces, toss with a little olive oil and salt in a shallow baking pan and place it about 3-4" inches below the heat of my oven's broiler. I keep an eye on it and toss the asparagus when it starts getting a bit charred on the top. Keep tossing now and then until it is done to your liking. This takes 10 minutes or less. Eat "as is" or add to salads, pasta dishes, etc.

BRYANNA'S VEGAN HOLLANDAISE SAUCE

makes 1 c. (Can be soyfree)
This is a new recipe. Creamy, smooth and butter-y. 

1/2 c. plus 1/4 c. unflavored soymilk or other nondairy milk (3/4 c. total)
2 T. Earth Balance or Soy Garden Natural Buttery Spread, melted and kept warm
1 and 3/4 T. cornstarch or wheat starch 
*Note: Do not substitute arrowroot, tapioca starch, or kuzu— I tried these and the results were not satisfactory.
1 T. fresh lemon juice
1/2 tsp. salt
pinch of white pepper or a dash of hot pepper sauce
tiny pinch of tumeric (less than a 1/16th of a tsp—more makes a phony-looking color) 

Heat the 1/2 c. soymilk until not quite simmering—pour into the blender container along with the salt, pepper or hot sauce, and cover to keep hot while you melt the Earth Balance and go on to the next step. 

In a small (2 c.) saucepan or microwave-proof bowl, mix together the first 1/4 c. of soymilk and the cornstarch and tumeric, and whisk together well. 

If making in a pot on the stovetop, stir constantly over high heat until thick and translucent, shiny yellow, not a dull yellow

Japanese-Style Sesame Green Beans
